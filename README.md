# Contact App

The Contact App is a simple application that allows you to manage your contacts. You can add, remove, and edit contacts using this app. The contacts are stored in a JSON Server.

## Features

- Add a new contact: Enter the contact's name, phone number, and email address to add a new contact to the list.
- Remove a contact: Select a contact from the list and remove it from your contacts.
- Edit a contact: Update the details of an existing contact, including the name, phone number, and email address.

## Technologies Used

The Contact App is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: The user interface of the app is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Styling**: CSS is used for styling the app's components.
- **Backend**: The contacts are stored using JSON Server, a simple RESTful API server that uses a JSON file as a data source.

## Setup

To run the Contact App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
4. Start the JSON Server with the command `npm run server`. This will start the JSON Server and serve the contacts data from a JSON file.
5. Open another terminal window and start the development server with the command `npm start`. This will start the frontend development server.
6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Contact App.
